        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deep-fried <strong>mozzarella sticks</strong> are one of our favorite appetizers. I figured out how to make them at home without having to haul out the deep fryer. Make sure to double-bread each one so these air-fryer mozzarella sticks get nice and crunchy, and to keep the cheese from oozing out as they get warm.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2-1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>12 sticks string cheese</li>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 cup marinara sauce or meatless pasta sauce, warmed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, beat eggs and water. In a third shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. Coat cheese sticks with flour, then dip in egg mixture and coat with bread crumb mixture. Repeat egg and bread crumb coatings. Cover and freeze for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 400Â°. Place cheese in a single layer on greased tray in air-fryer basket; spritz with cooking spray. Cook until golden brown and heated through, 6-8 minutes, turning halfway through cooking and spritzing with additional cooking spray. Allow to stand 3-5 minutes before serving. Serve with marinara or pasta sauce for dipping.</li>
