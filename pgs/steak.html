        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you’ve never cooked steak at home before, it can be a little intimidating. That’s why I came up with this simple steak recipe that’s so easy, you could make it any day of the week.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 beef New York strip or ribeye steak (1 pound), 1 inch thick</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove steak from refrigerator and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons salt; let stand 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until extremely hot, 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon salt in bottom of skillet; pat beef dry with paper towels. Place steak in skillet and cook until easily moved, 1-2 minutes; flip, placing steak in a different section of the skillet. Cook 30 seconds and then begin moving steak, occasionally pressing slightly to ensure even contact with skillet.</li>
            <li>Continue turning and flipping until cooked to desired degree of doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°), 1-2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
